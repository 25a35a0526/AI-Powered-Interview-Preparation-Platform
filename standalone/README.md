```javascript
questionDatabase.technical.medium.push({
    text: "Your question here?",
    category: "Category Name",
    answer: "Expected answer or key points"
});
```

### Adjust Interview Length
In `app.js`, `startNewInterview()` function:
```javascript
state.interviewData.questions = (typeQuestions[difficulty] || typeQuestions.easy).slice(0, 10); // Change 5 to desired count
```

### Change Timer Duration
In `app.js`, `startTimer()` function:
```javascript
let timeLeft = 600; // Change from 300 (5 min) to your preference (in seconds)
```

### Modify Scoring Algorithm
In `app.js`, `evaluateAnswer()` function - customize the mock AI scoring logic.

## Performance Tips

- **First Load:** Takes a few seconds to fully render
- **Chart Rendering:** Canvas charts redraw on every dashboard load (instant)
- **Data Sync:** localStorage is synchronous, no lag on save
- **Client-Side Only:** No network requests (completely offline after load)

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium 60+
- ✅ Firefox 55+
- ✅ Safari 12+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Limitations vs Full Stack

| Feature | Standalone | Full-Stack |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Backend API | ❌ Mock only | ✅ Real |
| Database | localStorage | MongoDB/SQL |
| User Accounts | Local only | Server-stored |
| Real AI | ❌ Mock | ✅ OpenAI/Claude |
| Multi-Device | ❌ Per device | ✅ Synced |
| Analytics | Basic | Advanced |

## Troubleshooting

### Questions Not Appearing
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify `app.js` loaded successfully
- Clear localStorage: DevTools → Application → Clear All

### Charts Not Rendering
- Ensure canvas elements present in HTML
- Check browser supports Canvas API (all modern browsers do)
- Open console for errors

### Dark Mode Not Persisting
- Check localStorage is enabled in browser
- Try in non-private/incognito window

### Interview Score Always 0
- Verify answer input has content
- Check answer length > 0 characters
- Console errors indicate issues
